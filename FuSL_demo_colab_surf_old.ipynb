This pipline consists of two steps to prepare the data for FuSL. In the first step we load the datafiles and store it in a pandas dataframe (running the `load_fusl_cifti_data` function). In a next step we generate a numpy array and labels from this dataframe, which serve as inputs for FuSL (running the `prepare_fusl_data` function). There are three possibilities where you can enter your own data into this workflow:\n","\n","- You can either structure and name your data files in the same manner as in this example in the `data` directory\n","- Or you can generate a pandas dataframe which has the same structure as `input_df`, including the matrix contaning searchlight neighborhoods (`neigh_adj`) (see `compute_neighborhoods.py`)\n","- Or you can generate a numpy array (`X`) and labels (`y`) containing your data, including an adjacency matrix contaning the fusion searchlight neighborhoods (`fusl_adj`)\n","\n","The following script utilizes artificial data in the fsLR standard space in cifti format. You can alternatively run FuSL on your data in nifti format using the other demo (`FuSL_demo_vol.ipynb`) provided in this repository."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Clone repository.\n","!git
